# g-sliders
Like sliders, little pieces that make google slides more digestible.

In my particular case, my first annoyance is with marketing choosing fancy fonts in notes, rather than practical and readable font when you have to deliver the content. Also, annoyed with Google Slides lacking usability. Grateful for and inspired by the [Google Slides Auto Resize Speaker Notes](https://github.com/daattali/gslides-betternotes-extension) by Dean Attali.

Future Google slide annoyances will be posted here.
